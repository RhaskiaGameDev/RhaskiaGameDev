### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Unity C# programmer, as well as a pixel artist, and have around 2 and a half years of experience in both.

Projects
- The Mesocene, an RPG with over 240+ prehistoric creatures that I'm working on with some folks
- Deep Under, a game set deep under the surface on a watery planet, with (not yet implemented) sound and disturbance mechanics.
- Gridle, a word game that is a bit of a mix between wordle and something else.
